# northstar-updater
Two shell scripts for the TF|2 Northstar client that update/install.

[1.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/northstar-updater/releases/download/northstar-updaters/northstar-updater.sh) Latest release.

[2.](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/northstar-updater/releases/download/northstar-updaters/northstar-mods-updater.sh) Only NorthstarMods (git).

They work in the current directory so put them in the game folder. Before using, allow executing.

In the first installer, the first command was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/lukechilds/a83e1d7127b78fef38c2914c4ececc3c?permalink_comment_id=4132245#gistcomment-4132245) although I edited it a bit (curl instead of wget).
