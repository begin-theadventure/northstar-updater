Shell script **up**daters/insta**llers** for the TF|2 Northstar client.

In the first installer, the first command was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/lukechilds/a83e1d7127b78fef38c2914c4ececc3c?permalink_comment_id=4132245#gistcomment-4132245) although I edited it a bit (curl instead of wget).
